	This "libinclude.cpp" file must be coppied into
	any project folder which must access the contents of this library.
	The corresponding "libinclude.h" must also be coppied, and included at the head 
	of all translation units (code files) which directly call library functions.

	This is the library include file for the sc7-can code
